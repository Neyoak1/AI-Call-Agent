## Project Overview
This project is an **AI-powered outbound calling system** built using **n8n**, **ElevenLabs AI Agent**, and **Twilio**.  
The workflow automates **customer outreach**, **identity verification**, and **post-call logging**, integrating seamlessly with Google Sheets for dynamic data handling.

The system is designed for businesses that want to **automate outbound calls** while maintaining **real-time verification** and **automatic record-keeping**.

---

## Purpose
The main goal of this workflow is to:
- **Automate outbound customer calls** with a natural AI voice agent.
- **Verify customer identity and capture details** during live conversations.
- **Automatically log call transcripts and updates** into a Google Sheet for tracking and analytics.
- Reduce the need for manual follow-ups by human agents.

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Call Initiation (Outbound Trigger)
- Trigger: Workflow starts manually or via schedule.
- Retrieves **phone numbers** and **customer records** from a Google Sheet.
- Initiates a call via **ElevenLabs AI Agent**, with phone numbers provisioned through **Twilio**.
- Workflow: (see `call agent.png`)

### 2. Real-Time Client Verification
- During the call, the AI agent **verifies the client's identity** using details (like name or ID) fetched from the Google Sheet.
- The agent can **log any new information or responses** from the client during the call.
- Workflow: (see `webhook update.png`)

### 3. Post-Call Transcript Logging
- After the call, the **recording is transcribed**.
- The transcript is **sent back to n8n** via a webhook.
- The transcript is **automatically logged or updated** in the Google Sheet for future reference and reporting.
- Workflow: (see `webkook extract.png`)

---

## Use Case
This workflow is ideal for:
- **Customer verification campaigns** (banks, fintech, subscription services).
- **Follow-up and feedback collection** for businesses.
- **Automated surveys and outbound notifications**.
- Any business needing to **log structured conversation data** automatically.

---

## Future Improvements
- **Add CRM Integration** (HubSpot, Salesforce) to sync customer records directly.
- **Enable SMS follow-up** for unreachable customers.
- **Add call analytics dashboard** for better tracking and reporting.
- **Enhance voice personalization** using advanced ElevenLabs AI features.
- **Automate call scheduling** based on time zones and customer preferences.
